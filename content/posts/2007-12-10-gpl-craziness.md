Sometimes, late at night when the moon is full and no one is around, I&#8217;ll download the Emacs source. Then, I&#8217;ll make a single change. Maybe rename a variable or a function, or comment something out. Then, I&#8217;ll recompile it and put the binary on my website for people to download. But I won&#8217;t provide the source of my changes! Muahahahaha.
