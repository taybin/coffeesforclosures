[This](http://ciaranwal.sh/files/BlurMate.tmplugin.zip) is pretty cool. A way to set the opacity on your [Textmate](http://macromates.com/) window.

I&#8217;m usually against this sort of transparency-everywhere mentality; it reminds me of the [Enlightenment](http://enlightenment.org/) window manager for Linux.

But this works really nicely.
