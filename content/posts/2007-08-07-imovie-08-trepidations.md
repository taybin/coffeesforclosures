This makes very little sense to me. What about those of us who want to spend time working on their movies but who want to avoid Final Cut Pro/Express? Who expects to be able to do great things in just a couple of minutes?

When I make a movie, what I like to do is pick out a soundtrack, and then layout the clips in time with the music. I also like to adjust the volume curves to have different sounds fade in and out as appropriate. In the iMovie &#8217;08 tutorials I&#8217;ve seen, you don&#8217;t get a timeline anymore. You get a box. You don&#8217;t get an audio waveform anymore. You get a shade of green in the box background.

I&#8217;m still going to buy iLife &#8217;08, in the hopes that these features are still enabled somewhere. But I&#8217;m going to hide my iMovie &#8217;06 application where it can&#8217;t be deleted in case it sucks.

The irony is that I was just telling a co-worker how iMovie is my favorite piece of software, of all time. The explorability of the software, with its undo-everywhere, was key. I still believe that unless you&#8217;re working with two video cameras, iMovie will serve most of your needs.

When I worked at an art school, I would teach students how to use iMovie, and I would always stress how important it was to experiment and that it didn&#8217;t matter if they made mistakes, because you could always undo. I&#8217;m sure undo is still a big part of the program. But getting rid of timelines seems too big a step away from traditional movie editing.
