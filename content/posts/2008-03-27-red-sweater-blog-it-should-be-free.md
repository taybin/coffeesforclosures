[Red Sweater Blog &#8211; It Should Be Free](http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/481/it-should-be-free)

I don&#8217;t care if someone charges for an app or not. But one thing that has always puzzled me is why there are so many free (as in beer) applications for the mac that aren&#8217;t also open source. If you&#8217;re giving your application away for free, why not show the source too?

My only guess is that the default-to-open-source attitude isn&#8217;t as ingrained in the mac world as is it elsewhere.
