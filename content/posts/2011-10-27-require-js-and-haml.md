I&#8217;ve been having very good luck with [requirehaml](https://github.com/jakewins/requirehaml "requirehaml"). I had been looking around at various templates, but none of them seemed to support compiling before delivery to the client. This script does that and compiles them into easily verifiable javascript files, packaged up to be included with my existing [require.js](http://requirejs.org "require.js") AMD build.

So far, I haven&#8217;t actually had that much HTML to include, but hopefully that will change as my project takes shape and grows.

Now I just need to find something to do the same for [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/ "SASS").
