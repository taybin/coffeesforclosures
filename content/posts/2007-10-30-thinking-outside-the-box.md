[Gruber isn&#8217;t very good at imagining](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/october#tue-30-java) [other people&#8217;s computing needs](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/august#tue-07-imovie_08).

I think he meant &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any important software that depends on Java&#8221;. There. Fixed that for you.

What I like about the most about his subsequent [backpedaling](http://daringfireball.net/2007/10/shipping_means_prioritizing) is that it avoids the original issue people were complaining about.

1. Gruber says Java isn&#8217;t supported in the new MacOS X 10.5 and no one cares except Java developers.
2. People who do care write him and complain.
3. Instead of saying, &#8220;oh, hey, some people clearly have different computing needs than me,&#8221; Gruber gives them a condescending lecture on prioritizing development issues, which wasn&#8217;t the point at all and as if developers don&#8217;t already know about needing to delay low priority tasks.

Somewhere in there he also found the time to talk about a new feature to AppleScript, a language that no one cares about, except AppleScript developers.

PS. I&#8217;m not a Java developer. Â I don&#8217;t even care for Java.
