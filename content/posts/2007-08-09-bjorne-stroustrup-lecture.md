I saw [Bjorne Stroustrup](http://www.research.att.com/~bs/homepage.html) give a lecture as part of the New York City Google TechTalks. Pretty interesting stuff. More updates to the language that I was expecting. Some much desired features too.

Two downsides:

1. the language is going to be that much more complicated. I&#8217;m looking at you, separate meta-type system for controlling templates
2. it took so long for the STL and templates to get good enough support, I doubt I&#8217;ll see any of this until 2015
