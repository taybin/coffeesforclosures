sucks. The installation process for getting a build environment is the most painful series of steps I have ever taken in an install. You have to download the program. Then you download the SDKs. Then you have to edit the paths in the IDE. Then you have to open the project template files and comment out various obscure configurations if you want to have a workable setup.

[_Why_](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/) are these many steps necessary? Thank god I&#8217;m already an engineer and could figure it out. For a Microsoft product, I&#8217;m really disappointed. Don&#8217;t they have a product manager for these things? Or do they just let anyone decide when to ship their software.

A little professionalism please, okay guys?
