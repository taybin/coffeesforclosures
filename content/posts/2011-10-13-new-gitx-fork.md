It&#8217;s good to see that someone has taken up the [GitX](http://gitx.frim.nl/ "GitX") mantle, since the original hasn&#8217;t been updated since September, 2009. There have been a bunch of forks, notably [brotherbard](https://github.com/brotherbard/gitx "brotherbard")&#8216;s fork.

But this is the first time I&#8217;ve seen [active development with actual releases](http://gitx.laullon.com/). Nice to know I&#8217;m not relying on [abandoned software](http://macromates.com/).
