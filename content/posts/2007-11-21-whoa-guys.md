In Vacuous Virtuoso&#8217;s [CTGradient code bloat](http://lipidity.com/apple/ctgradient-code-bloat/) article, he showed how easy it was to trim a 1300 line 3rd party piece of code down to 30 lines by trimming the unneeded code.

Super. We should all look at what code we use and whether it is inefficient or not.

The problem is he didn&#8217;t include any numbers beyond the LOCs. It would have been nice to have had some before and after numbers on execution speed, binary size, and memory usage.

No big deal though. It&#8217;s still a decent article.

It&#8217;s turned into a bit of a flame war though, or as close to a flame war as the usually polite Mac developer community gets.

I started it with what I like to think of was an [innocuous](http://lipidity.com/apple/ctgradient-code-bloat/comment-page-1/%23comment-39149) comment.

It went back and forth a little bit with [Daniel Jalkut](http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/) [joining in too](http://lipidity.com/apple/ctgradient-code-bloat/comment-page-1/%23comment-39180).

Then this guy, [Rick](http://rixstep.com/), [joined in](http://lipidity.com/apple/ctgradient-code-bloat/comment-page-2/#comment-39353) and immediately went personal.

Rick also posted a fun little [timecube](timecube.com) style rant on his [blog](http://www.rixstep.com/2/1/20071121,00.shtml) where he referred to developers as the _Landed Gentry of Mac Development_ and as _snakes_. He also put the word &#8220;people&#8221; in scare quotes.

> It&#8217;s also amazing how far these &#8216;people&#8217; will go to defend what essentially is a defenceless position.

Not quite sure what he thinks we are instead.

[Sean](http://www.seanmcollins.com/site/Intro.html) was totally unnecessary with his

style comments.

I just think that the personal attacks are pretty lame in a discussion by a bunch of developers about the relative merits of a code cleanup.
