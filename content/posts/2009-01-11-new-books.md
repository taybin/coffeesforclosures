I bought a couple books today. I picked up [Managing Humans](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159059844X) and [Real World Haskell](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596514980).

Managing Humans really needed a better editor. Maybe I&#8217;m not in the manager mindframe enough to understand it, but it jerked around and contradicted itself.

I&#8217;m hoping the Haskell book isn&#8217;t as disappointing. I&#8217;ve been wanting to understand functional programming for a long time, but never got around to picking up a book that explained how to model real programs that rely on input from the outside world.
