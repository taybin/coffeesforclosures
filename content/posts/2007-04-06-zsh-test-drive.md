Based on stuffonfire&#8217;s [zsh shout out](http://www.stuffonfire.com/2007/04/05/shout-out-to-zsh/), I&#8217;ll be switching to it on all my accounts and giving it a whirl. I&#8217;ve made it halfway through the [user&#8217;s guide](http://zsh.dotsrc.org/Guide/), but I might look for an actual book too.

I need to look up the syntax for [bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) every time I write a **for** loop, so I don&#8217;t have to worry about the difficulty of forgetting my old knowledge. I&#8217;ll post if I find anything interesting about it.
