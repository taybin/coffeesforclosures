I thought [this paper](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2006/ashopl.pdf) was pretty interesting, since AppleScript is my favorite language to hate. An interesting, but failed experiment. I entirely support its aims though. The problem of how to replace command line pipes in a GUI environment is still an interesting one.
