I&#8217;ve seen a lot of [blog](http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/27/iphone-returns-and-cancellation-policies/) updates talking about the true cost of the iPhone, including the monthly fees. It comes to about $2000+ for two years. Which is true, and should be considered if you&#8217;ve never had a cell phone before.

They should be subtracting the current fees they&#8217;re already paying. I pay about $60 a month, which coincides with the $60 a month AT&T plan that&#8217;s being offered. So really, my main consideration is whether I can afford the iPhone itself. The monthly fees will stay the same.
