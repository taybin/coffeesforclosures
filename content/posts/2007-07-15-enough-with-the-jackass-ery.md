[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/july#sat-14-arends) attacks someone for criticizing the iPod. In this case, a mutual funds analyst who says that it would be better to invest the money instead of buying an iPod. Which is a good point to make. Too many people fritter their money away on gadgets instead of investing it.

Not sure why that qualifies the man as a &#8220;jackass&#8221;, but Gruber throws that term around a lot anyways.
