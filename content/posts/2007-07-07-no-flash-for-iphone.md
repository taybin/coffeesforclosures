I don&#8217;t want flash for the iPhone. People forget about how CPU heavy flash is. I don&#8217;t want a bunch of stupid punch the monkey ads running down my battery everytime I load a webpage. Many ads nowadays are Flash based and having all these tiny banner ad programs running in the background will be too much. The battery is already tottering on the edge of annoyingly frequent recharges.
