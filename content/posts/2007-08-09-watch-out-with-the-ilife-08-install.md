After you install it, and launch iChat, it&#8217;ll run the iChat config program. After that, it&#8217;ll ask you about syncing your Address Book. Don&#8217;t do this. I just lost _all_ my contacts from my address book. It then deleted them from my iPhone.

All in all, this hasn&#8217;t been a good week between me and Apple.
