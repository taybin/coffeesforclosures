This is old news, in blog time, but Gruber&#8217;s [response](http://daringfireball.net/2007/04/bottleneck) to Jalkut&#8217;s [comment](http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/321/leopard-isnt-the-problem) on the Leopard delay misses a couple points.

Gruber says:

> That’s right in the middle of the most productive stretch in Mac OS X history – 10.0.0 was released in March 2001, 10.1.0 was released in September, and 10.2.0 was released less than a year after that in August 2002.

It only looks productive if you&#8217;re going by the numbering scheme. The features introduced in the increments from 10.0->10.1->10.2 were nowhere near as large as what was introduced in 10.3 and 10.4.

10.0 was unusable. That&#8217;s why 10.1 was given away _for free_ six months after 10.0 was released. 10.2 came soon after because 10.1 still wasn&#8217;t very good.

If the release version numbers weren&#8217;t determined by marketing, 10.1 should have been 10.0.1 and 10.2 should have been 10.1.

As far as I can tell, 10.4 was the first release of OS X where it felt _slower_.
