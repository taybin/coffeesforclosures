I came across an [interesting post](http://onsmalltalk.com/programming/smalltalk/rails-vs-seaside/) about SmallTalk&#8217;s Seaside versus Ruby&#8217;s Rails.

The meat is in the comments which are very polite and informative. I&#8217;ve only played with [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/) once back in college so I didn&#8217;t really grasp the whole editing-live-objects-which-don&#8217;t-live-in-files thing.

It sounds pretty neat and pretty powerful.
