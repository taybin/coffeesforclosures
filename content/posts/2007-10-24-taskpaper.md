[Taskpaper](http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper) has a nice idea, using a plaintext microformat to store TODO lists. Seems unfortunate that it&#8217;s getting [so](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/october#mon-22-taskpaper) [much](http://www.43folders.com/2007/10/24/taskpaper-release-1) [press](http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/10/24/minireview-getting-things-done-with-taskpaper-1-0) a week before Leopard comes out with the [same feature](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail.html) with presumably the same implementation.

I&#8217;ve long thought that TODO lists were overdue for an IMAP style, access this anywhere from any client, protocol. Nice to see Apple implementing it and it looks like they&#8217;re skipping the design-a-new-protocol phase and just using IMAP for the TODO list.

Next up, a standard way of syncing read RSS feeds? I&#8217;d like that very much, kthxbye.
