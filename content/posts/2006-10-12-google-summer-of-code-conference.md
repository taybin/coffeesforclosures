I&#8217;m going to the Google Summer of Code conference this Saturday. I&#8217;m flying out to San Jose tomorrow morning.

I&#8217;m pretty excited. I&#8217;ll be leading a discussion of cheap, homegrown ways to reward contributors to open source projects.

Then, I&#8217;ll fly to LA to visit some friends. And since I&#8217;ve never been to California before, this is all new to me. Too bad I won&#8217;t have time to check out San Francisco. Oh well.
