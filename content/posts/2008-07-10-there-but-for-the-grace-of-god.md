I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;m not an Apple Release Engineer today. Four major releases today. iPhone 3G, iPhone Firmware 2.0, MobileMe, and iTunes 7.7.

It&#8217;s a huge task to synchronize all those releases and it eats up company resources like crazy. You have to have enough people to focus on each task separately.

MobileMe still isn&#8217;t working right. They&#8217;ve been extending the maintenance downtime further and further.

They have my sympathies.
