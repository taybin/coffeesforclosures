There was a bit of downtime at work while we waited for QA to verify our release. I took the oppurtunity to get my workstation running lean and mean.

First thing was to find a good font. I&#8217;m pretty sick of Monaco. After looking at basically all of the available free programming fonts, I went with [Deja Vu](http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). It&#8217;s just like the [BitStream Vera](http://www.gnome.org/fonts/), but with more international characters. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, they&#8217;re the one true font.

The second thing to get was [TmCodeBrowser](http://www.cocoabits.com/TmCodeBrowser/), for browsing code in [TextMate](http://macromates.com). TextMate&#8217;s built-in parser is a little weak. I&#8217;m sure there is a good reason why it doesn&#8217;t recognize a function declaration that&#8217;s been split up over multiple lines, but it&#8217;s a little surprising from a program that is insistent on the use of regular expressions.

I also grabbed [Menu Meters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/), mostly as a way of checking if I had unknowingly written an infinite loop or memory leak.

Finally, I tweaked [colormake](http://bre.klaki.net/programs/colormake/) to not highlight anything except errors and warnings and installed that too.
