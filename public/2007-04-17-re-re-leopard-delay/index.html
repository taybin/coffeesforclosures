                    <p>This is old news, in blog time, but Gruber&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/04/bottleneck">response</a> to Jalkut&#8217;s <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/321/leopard-isnt-the-problem">comment</a> on the Leopard delay misses a couple points.</p>

<p>Gruber says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s right in the middle of the most productive stretch in Mac OS X history – 10.0.0 was released in March 2001, 10.1.0 was released in September, and 10.2.0 was released less than a year after that in August 2002.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It only looks productive if you&#8217;re going by the numbering scheme. The features introduced in the increments from 10.0-&gt;10.1-&gt;10.2 were nowhere near as large as what was introduced in 10.3 and 10.4.</p>

<p>10.0 was unusable. That&#8217;s why 10.1 was given away <em>for free</em> six months after 10.0 was released. 10.2 came soon after because 10.1 still wasn&#8217;t very good.</p>

<p>If the release version numbers weren&#8217;t determined by marketing, 10.1 should have been 10.0.1 and 10.2 should have been 10.1.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, 10.4 was the first release of OS X where it felt <em>slower</em>.</p>
